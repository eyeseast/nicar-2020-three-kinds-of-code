        As we got into the hiring process, I started making a list of all the
        skills we might need, so I could compare candidates. 
        
        This got overwhelming pretty quickly.

      <notes>
      I didn't realize it at the time, but this was part of a problem I'd been struggling with in different ways since I started writing code for journalism, back when GW Bush was still president. 
        
        It's a problem of language.

There's an overwhelming number of skills and tools we use in writing code around news. Most of those, and most job descriptions, are lumped together into titles like "news applications" or "interactives" or data journalism.

      Reporting. Storytelling. Product.
      <notes>Then a few months ago, a friend who teaches journalism asked me to talk to one of her students who was a talented photographer and also starting a comp sci program. And he wanted to know what to do with that set of skills. And after talking to him and thinking about the jobs I've had, I realized that ultimately, there are three kinds of code we write in newsrooms:

Reporting. Storytelling. Product.
        
And that's pretty much it. So what do I mean by reporting, storytelling and product?

    <div>
      Reporting
      <notes>Reporting code is, well, reporting. It's scraping, data analysis, machine learning and natural language processing. When you're using SQL, R, Pandas and Jupyter notebooks, you're probably writing code I'd call reporting.</notes>
    </div>
    <div>
      Storytelling
      <notes>Storytelling is, of course, what we do with all that reporting. It's our graphics, interactive or not, and maps and charts and generative text. AR and VR and 3D modeling.</notes>
    </div>
    <div>
      Product
      <notes>And what is product? You might be thinking: We have another department that does that. They're IT, and I'm in the newsroom. 
And I'm here to say, more of us are doing product than we realize.

Product is everything we build that isn't for just one story or project. It's everything we do between deadlines that makes our next project launch faster or run smoother or get a little closer to what our audience needs. (In fact, it's everywhere we talk about user needs.) 

It's anything we need to maintain, and anything that accumulated technical debt. (You might say it is the technical debt.) 
        
It's our app templates and starter kits that we update after we launch a project. It's our longform tool. It's our open source code. It's our analytics packages and documented best practices.
